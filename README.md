# About my React Portfolio Website

The Original design of this portfolio website was designed by [Elvis Obi](http://linkedin/in/ElvisObi), refined and developed by [Me](http://github.com/iAhm-Codes) and created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as it is designed to be a single-page Application to showcase past work.

## Code layout

In the project directory:

### `SCSS` CSS extension was used for nesting and functional styling
### `AOS` - Animated on Scroll to provide beautiful animation in list components
### `Emailjs` for Client Emailing services
### `React-Hooks` in updating states in the app
### `A QR-Code` component toggled with the useState Hook to view Resume instead of dowloading it

## Continuous integration

I intend to continue working on my portfolio and stating clearly the tools I used in creating different functions
